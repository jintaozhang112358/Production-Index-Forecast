# Durable Consumer Goods Industrial Production Index Forecasting

Durable consumer goods, such as cars and computers, are less prone to fluctuations in demand than non-durable goods like food. Therefore, the consumption of durable goods can be a good indicator of people's spending power. This is why the Industrial Production Index of durable consumer goods, which is often driven by demand, can provide valuable insights into the demand for these goods and people's ability to spend.

This project analyzes the historical time series of the Industrial Production Index of Durable Consumer Goods and builds a forecasting model on it.
